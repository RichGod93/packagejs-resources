# template-blog-static template

- This repository branch holds the resource folders and files for the template-blog-static template. </br>
- Download the code, extract the zip contents and copy over the functions and public folders from the ui folder into your build. </br>
- In the  `workspace` folder, you will find the `packagejs.zip` folder, that is the workspace you will need to extract and copy into your `var/lib/packagejs/data` directory.
- You might not have any need for the `onefile.zip` folder because one will be created for you when you run `npm run deploy` from the api.
